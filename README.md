# exploratory-data-analysis---customer-loans-in-finance319
Perform exploratory data analysis on the loan portfolio, using various statistical and data visualisation techniques to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the loan data.

## Project description
The aim of this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the loan portfolio data of a large financial instiution by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using various statistical and data visualistion methods, demonstrating a strong understanding and knowledge of these techniques. This will enable patterns, relationships and anomalies in the data to be revealed, thereby facilitating the improvement of the the performance and profitability of the loan portfolio. 

This project will be a practical application and demonstration of the various data analysis skills I have developed in the AiCore data analysis course.

The first section of the project is EDA for data cleaning and preparation. The process is as follows:
Columns in the dataframe are converted to the correct type
Missing/null values are handled on a case-by-case basis, and are either dropped, imputed or the whole variable is removed
Skewed columns are identified and handled by transformation
Outliers are identified and removed if appropriate
Overly correlated columns are identified and dropped
